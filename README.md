Where do investors succeed in the housing market?

The data consists of all residential leases and sales in Bright MLS for 2022 and 2023.

The objective of this project is to analyze and present comprehensive data on the housing market to assist investors in making informed decisions about real estate investments. The data will cover various aspects of the market, including bedrooms, neighborhoods, zip codes, days on the market, change in prices/rent over a 1-2 year span, and numbers of sales in certain areas.

The deliverables for this project will include a comprehensive presentation summarizing my housing market data analysis, key findings, insights, and recommendations for investors.
